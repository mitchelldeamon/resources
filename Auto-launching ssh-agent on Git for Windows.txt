## 1

Locate your ".gitconfig" file

My file was located in "C:\Users\mitch"

## 2 

Open text editor and past the following:

env=~/.ssh/agent.env

agent_load_env () { test -f "$env" && . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_start () {
    (umask 077; ssh-agent >| "$env")
    . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_load_env

# agent_run_state: 0=agent running w/ key; 1=agent w/o key; 2=agent not running
agent_run_state=$(ssh-add -l >| /dev/null 2>&1; echo $?)

if [ ! "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] || [ $agent_run_state = 2 ]; then
    agent_start
    ssh-add
elif [ "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] && [ $agent_run_state = 1 ]; then
    ssh-add
fi

unset env

## 3 

Navigate to > File > Save As > ".bashrc" to same file path where ".gitconfig" is located

## 4

Open new finder window and Locate your ssh key path and copy by highlighting 
and right clicking id_ed25519 File (not the pub) and "copy as path"
My file path was "C:\Users\mitch\.ssh\id_ed25519"

## 5 

After copying path, navigate back to ".bashrc" file and paste file path after "ssh-add" (two locations)

env=~/.ssh/agent.env

agent_load_env () { test -f "$env" && . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_start () {
    (umask 077; ssh-agent >| "$env")
    . "$env" >| /dev/null ; }

agent_load_env

# agent_run_state: 0=agent running w/ key; 1=agent w/o key; 2=agent not running
agent_run_state=$(ssh-add -l >| /dev/null 2>&1; echo $?)

if [ ! "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] || [ $agent_run_state = 2 ]; then
    agent_start
    ssh-add "C:\Users\mitch\.ssh\id_ed25519"
elif [ "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" ] && [ $agent_run_state = 1 ]; then
    ssh-add "C:\Users\mitch\.ssh\id_ed25519"
fi

unset env

## 6 

The next time you open Git Bash it will give you a prompt saying it has 
added a ".bash_profile" to which you will be all set
